# HealthNotebook

This is a joint project created by [Heidi](https://github.com/heksaani), [Lotta](https://github.com/LottaPol) and [Tatu](https://github.com/tlinnala) for the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://studies.helsinki.fi/kurssit/opintojakso/hy-CU-118209216-2021-08-01) at the University of Helsinki.

## Project description
Our task was to come up with inspiring idea to get familiar with different aspects of data science. We came with idea of creating a interactive jupyter notebook, since the time is limited. This could be further developed into a web and/or mobile application.

## Data
Used datasets:
<br>
- [Boston College COVID-19 Sleep and Well-Being Dataset](https://osf.io/gpxwa/?view_only=) <br>
- [FSD2326 University Student Health Survey 2004](https://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:fsd:T-FSD2326) <br>


## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heksaani/DataScienceProject.git
cd DataScienceProject
```
2. Install the required packages and activate the environment
```bash
conda create --name <env>
conda activate <env>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebook
This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook App and open this project in your browser.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
When using the notebook you can run the cells by pressing the play button or by pressing shift + enter. <br>
We recommend you to run the cells one by one and fille the qustions and remember to push the button 'Submit' after filling the question boxes. <br>
